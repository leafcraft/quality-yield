"""Per-session QA stash — bridges the HITL gap + bounds rework loops.

Two jobs:

1. Bridge the human gate. When a QA manager / inspector / plant engineer
   approves in the Studio inbox, the SDK resumes the chain with ONLY the
   human-response meta fields (human_message, human_decision, …) — the
   batch/defect payload that was flowing is not re-delivered to the next
   agent. The last pre-gate agent stashes the full batch + decision
   context here, keyed by session_id, so the batch-release actuator and
   the audit sink can recover it after the gate.

2. Bound rework loops. The qa_manager → plant_engineer rework back-edge
   is a counted loop: the stash holds a per-session rework counter so a
   bounded cap can escalate rather than spin (Rule 3 / 5).

In-process only — survives the human wait because the mesh is one
process. A multi-replica deployment swaps this for the Redis session
store; the get/put interface stays the same.
